**Installing wsl**

1. Open powershell.
    
2. Install wsl package
    

```bash
wsl.exe --install
```

3. Check installation using
    

```bash
wsl -v # or wsl --version
```

4. Install Ubuntu
    

```bash
# wsl --install <Distro_name>
wsl --install # it will install latest version of Ubuntu 24.04 as a default
```

5. Using ubuntu using WSL
    

```bash
 wsl -d Ubuntu # For using any other distro of linux replace Ubuntu with the Name of Distribution
```

### Ubuntu (Linux platform)

---

1. Use `sudo` to open file `/etc/default/grub`
    

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

1. Add `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` in the value of `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` variable.
    

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

If the line already contains other parameters, ensure you add this parameter within the quotes, separated by a space. For instance:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet splash systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

2. Apply the changes:
    

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

3. Restart your server:
    

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Common Installation

**Step 1: Open Linux CLI**

**Step 2: Upadate your System**

```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Step 3: Download** `Docker` and `Docker Compose` **(Skip If you have already installed)**

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io && sudo apt install docker-compose
```

**Step 4: Install** `unzip` **Package**

```bash
sudo apt install unzip
```

**Step 5: Download the judge0‚Äôs release archive**

```bash
wget https://github.com/judge0/judge0/releases/download/v1.13.1/judge0-v1.13.1.zip
```

**Step 6: Extract the judge0‚Äôs release archive**

```bash
unzip judge0-v1.13.1.zip
```

**Step 7: Go into** `judge0-v1.13.1` extracted folder

```bash
cd judge0-v1.13.1
```

**Step 8: Update the variable** `REDIS_PASSWORD` **in the** `judge0.conf` **file.**

```bash
nano judge0.conf
```

Instead of YourPassword use [generated password](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=32&format=plain&rnd=new) for both `REDIS_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

Passwords can be *different*(prefer) or *same*

1. Write and Save
    
    press ctrl + o and save as same name
    
2. To come out the file :
    
    press ctrl + x
    

> ‚ÄºÔ∏èDo not modify `docker-compose.yml`, modify it only if you know what are you doing üíÄ.

**Step 9:** Run these commands to initialize `redis` and `postgres`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db redis # use sudo for smooth experience
```

wait for initialization of `redis` and `postgres`.

**Step 10:** Run these commands to initialize `workers` and `server`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d # use sudo for smooth experience
```

After these commands end, your instance of Judge0 CE v1.13.0 is now available at : [`http://0.0.0.0:2358`](http://0.0.0.0:2358/) *or* [`http://localhost:2358`](http://localhost:2358/) don‚Äôt worry your installation is working if you are getting empty white-page.
